## Hi there 👋

I'm a data analyst who's drawn to making systems work better for people. I’ve always been someone who asks thoughtful questions, builds systems to support others, and keeps refining until things *make sense*. Whether it's rebuilding documentation, piecing together data from scratch, or creating tools to make everyday tasks easier, I’m driven by a mix of curiosity, clarity, and care.

### 👩‍💻 About Me

🧠 **Reflective Thinker:** I like to understand the "why" before jumping into the "how"   
📚 **Lifelong Learner (Philomath):** I go deep, ask questions, and follow side quests because I care about getting it right  
🤝 **Empathizer:** I value people and process equally, I work to make systems that actually serve those who use them  
✅ **Deliverer:** I follow through, notice the details, and build trust by doing what I say I’ll do  
🛠️ **Problem Solver:** I enjoy untangling complexity and turning it into something useful
